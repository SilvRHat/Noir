### ABOUT
Hello and welcome! to the character project for Noir- a spontaneous, ambitious, and crafty ghost girl. This summer project is all about bringing her to life in a gameplay world of her own. Get to know Noir and check out the project at:

#### Lens
Noir's goggles allow her to see the world in several unique perspectives specific to her. Those include: human, ghost, and time traveller views  
The dev page matches the theme and life of Noir by featuring this special feature with the query param `lens`. Check it out at:

### SOURCE
Currently, source code is kept locally and private. My motivations for maintaining a public repo are for a strong project image that I'm able to share with others.  
Over time, I expect to open source here: client-run rbx code, custom methods (modular format), and prototype notes and notebooks.  
If you're finding that something is not yet public here but are interested in, then feel free to contact me.


### SCOPE
This project covers development on the playable character 'Noir' for gameplay published on Roblox's Platform.
